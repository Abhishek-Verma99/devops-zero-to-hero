# Day 1 - Fundamentals of DevOps

## What is DevOps ?

- DevOps is a culture/ practice, that improves the organization's ability to deliver the applications.
- It is not only about improving the delivery, it is also about:
	- Automation
	- Quality
	- Continuous Monitoring/ Observability
	- Continuous Testing
- So, DevOps is a process of improving the application delivery but ensuring that the process is automated, monitored, tested and able to produce quality output.

## Why DevOps ?

### World before DevOps

- **Developers** write the code (make changes to application) and pushes it to a central repository
- **System Admins** create a server and deploys the modified application on this server
- **Testers** will test this application
- **Build and Release Engineers** promote the application to either Staging or Production environment, based on the testing phase
- Production environment requires an application server, which is created by **Server Admins**

### Disadvantages of this methodology

- Too many people involved, more prone to error
- Low quality of service for customers
- Bug fixes, error resolution takes a lot of time
- Lot of Manual Labor
- This led to the rise of a new methodology i.e, DEVOPS

## How to Introduce Yourself ?

- Tell about your experience (current and previous)
	- "I'm working as a DevOps Engineer with an experience of N years at XYZ Company. Before that I was working as ABC Engineer at ABC Company"
- Explain about your roles and responsibilities
	- "I take care of automation, I ensure that I setup Continuous Monitoring, etc"
- Tell about the tools used, if asked
