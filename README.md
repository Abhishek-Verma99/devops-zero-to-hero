# DevOps Course Notes

A huge shoutout to Abhishek Veeramalla for putting together this awesome DevOps course! I thoroughly enjoyed it - it was informative, engaging, and well-structured. His passion for the subject was contagious, and they made explaining complex concepts a breeze.

Inspired by the course, I decided to create this GitHub repository to share my notes with others. I hope these notes come in handy for anyone embarking on their DevOps journey.

I'm also super grateful to Abhishek for rekindling my passion for DevOps. I was feeling pretty lost career-wise, but this course has given me the confidence and skills to pursue my dream job in this field.
